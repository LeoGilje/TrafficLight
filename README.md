This project is a simple traffic light system made with an STM32 microcontroller. 
It uses red, yellow, and green LEDs to show light changes, and a button to test reaction time or trigger pedestrian mode. 
The code is written using STM32 HAL libraries and can be edited in Visual Studio Code or STM32CubeIDE. You can change how long each light stays on by adjusting the delays in the code. 
To use it, connect the LEDs and button to the right pins, build the project, and flash it to your STM32 board. Itâ€™s a great way to learn how microcontrollers work with real hardware.
